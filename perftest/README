These are some performance analysis code done to see if there were any obvious performance errors.

The C and ML code is a baseline and in general corresponds to a Habit file of the same name (or it should

BUILD
---------
make -j should build all the .out files, .s files and .fidget files. Fidget and .s are left for analysis

make Test builds a file named TestOut from the script test.sh which just executes every program and shows it's name next to the execution time
make TestHard does the same thing but runs every test 10 times.

make clean cleans the folder of everything (including TestOut files).

NOTES
---------

The Makefile, while verbose, has some documentation on what the different files do (the different files evolved fast enough to make documenting difficult. Exact details may be out of date)


Still trying to figure out how to get symbols to resolve.

ackermann is actually pretty interesting
