With the exception of `CNode` values, all kernel objects are $2^b$ bytes
long for some $b$, and must also be aligned on a $2^b$ byte boundary.  We
define the following synonyms for pointers and references to kernel objects
that capture this restriction on alignment (but not the restriction to power
of two sized objects):

> type KPtr s = APtr (ByteSize s) s

Every Cap takes 16 bytes of memory and should be 16-byte aligned.

> struct Cap /16
>   [ objptr  :: Stored Unsigned
>   | capdata :: Stored Unsigned
>   | prevlo  :: Stored CapLink
>   | nexthi  :: Stored CapLink ]

> type CapPtr  = KPtr Cap

The last two fields of every Cap contain pointers to other Cap values
that are used to form a doubly linked list:

> bitdata CapLink /WordSize
>   -- = CapLink [ cap :: APtr 16 Cap | val :: Bit 4 ]
>      = CapLink [ cap :: CapPtr      | val :: Bit 4 ]
