-- More tests of non-normal classes and improvements.  In this case, class 'C' has two functional
-- dependencies, each of which involves two of its arguments.

C a b c d | a ~> c, b ~> d.

C (Maybe Int) Float Int Bool.
C (Maybe Int) Int Int Float.
C (Maybe Float) Float Float Bool.

-- In the first two queries, we do not have enough refinment of the types (in particular, of the
-- first argument) to determine whether any axiom that resolves the predicate.  However, the second
-- argument is sufficient resolved to determine the fourth, giving rise to the improvement [Bool/v]
-- in each case.

C t Float u v?
C (Maybe t) Float u v?


-- In this case, both the first and second argumets are sufficient resolved to determine the third
-- and fourth arguments via the functional dependencies, and that is enough to solve the predicate.

C (Maybe Int) Float u v?
