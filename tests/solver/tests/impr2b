-- Tests the combination of pairwise improvement and generics.  Similar to impr2, but in this
-- version, the 'C' class does not have the functional dependency that it did in that version.
-- Thus, while the pairwise improvements can still be done, the C predicates generate no
-- improvements, and the queries as a whole cannot be discharged.

F t u | t ~> u.
D t u v | t u ~> v.

D t t True; D t u False.

-- The functional dependency on D does not cause a similar functional dependency on C.  The second
-- 'C' axiom demonstrates this.

C t u v if D t u v.
C t t Int if D t t Int fails.

F True Int.
F False Bool.

F a b, F a c, C b c a?
F a b, F a Bool, C b c a?

C b c a if F a b, F a c?
