-- This test is left over from one of the unification bugs.
F t t; F t u fails.
F Int Int?
F Int Bool?

-- Another unification bug: This verifies that bindings from matches in a sequence cannot allow
-- later matches to bind LHS variables.  In this case, when matching the goal against the first
-- clause of the 'C' axiom, binding [x/t] resulting from the first parameter should not allow the
-- binding [y/x] for the second.
--
-- Note that the goal ought to be solvable, requires cases.  The bug is demonstrated should the
-- solver find the improvement [True/z]

C t u v | t u ~> v.
C t t True; C t u False.
C x y z?
