-- More tests of the treatment of generic variables.

MEq t u | t ~> u.
MEq t t.

F t u | t ~> u.
F t (Maybe t).

-- In this query, the solver initially assumes that variable 't' is generic, while 'u', because it
-- appears in the determined position of the 'MEq' predicate, is not generic.  However, in improving
-- 'u' to 'Maybe t', variable 't' now appears in a determined position, and the solver must update
-- its notion of which variables are generic.

F t u, MEq (Maybe Int) u?
