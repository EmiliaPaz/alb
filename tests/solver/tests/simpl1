-- Simplification.  With inter-axiom backtracking, simplification can only trigger in cases where
-- other axioms are ruled out.  In this examples, there is nothing to prevent other instances 'C t',
-- so long as they require that 'D t' be disprovable.  However, other instances of 'C' t' are ruled
-- out by the trailing fails clause.  Thus, the C' (and E) examples can simplify, but the C example
-- cannot.

C t if D t.
C' t if D t; C' t fails.
E t if C t; E t fails.

C t?
C' t?
E t?
