-- Simplest possible use of proof-by-cases.  Note that 'C t' holds for all 't', but has a different
-- proof in the particular case that 't' = 'Int'.

C Int; C t.

-- Sanity checks: should use the second and first clauses, respectively.

C (Maybe Int)?
C Int?

-- For the final query, we should generate a proof by cases: under the condition [Int/t], the proof
-- is by the first clause of the axiom; otherwise, under the empty condition, the proof is by the
-- second clause.

C t?
