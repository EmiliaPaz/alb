-- 'G' and 'H' demonstrate the same difference between coherence and consistency, but for non-normal
-- relations.  For example, the two axioms for 'G' are more obviously non-overlapping, as Int =/=
-- Float.  However, this is not sufficient to show that the functional dependency is respected.

G t u v | u ~> v.
G Int m n if Double m n, Even n.
G Float m P1 if Double m n.
