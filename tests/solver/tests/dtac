-- Examples based on data types a la carte.  Explained in great, gory detail in
-- http://cs.pdx.edu/~jgmorris/d/final.pdf, section 3.4.  Queries are in 'dtac_tests'

-- Simple inclusion.

In f f;
In f (Plus g h) if In f g;
In f (Plus g h) if In f h;
In f g fails.

-- Unique inclusion.  A query like 'In Int (Plus Int Int)' holds, but makes an arbitrary (if
-- predictable) choice as to which 'Int' it finds.  In terms of an overloaded injection functions,
-- this means you would never be able to generate a value (Inr x).  UniqueIn rejects these cases.

UniqueIn f f;
UniqueIn f (Plus g h) if UniqueIn f g, In f h fails;
UniqueIn f (Plus g h) if UniqueIn f h, In f g fails;
UniqueIn f g fails.

-- Exclusion.  Roughly speaking, 'Without t u v' holds if 'v' contains all the types that 't' does
-- except for 'u'.

Without t u v | t u ~> v. -- , t v ~> u.
Without t t v fails;
Without (Plus t u) t u;
Without (Plus t u) u t;
Without (Plus t u) v (Plus t' u) if Without t v t', In v u fails;
Without (Plus t u) v (Plus t u') if Without u v u', In v t fails;
Without t u t.
