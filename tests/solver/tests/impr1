-- Improvement for non-normal axioms.  Note that variable 'v' does not participate in the functional
-- dependency on class 'C'.

C t u v | t ~> u.
D u v | u ~> v.

C Int Float Bool.
C Int Float Char.
D Float Bool.

-- Each of the queries below includes the predicate 'C Int u v'.  Note that this predicate cannot be
-- proven as stated (nor can the axiom used to prove it be inferred from its assumption): since 'v'
-- does not participate in the functional dependency, it must be refined to determine which of the
-- axioms is applicable.  However, because the determining part of the functional dependency is
-- specified, the predicate can be used to infer the improvement [Float/u], even without being able
-- to resolve it.  This is sufficient to prove the 'D u v' predicate in each case, allowing the
-- entire query to be solved.

C Int u v, D u v?
D u v, C Int u v?
D u v if C Int u v?
