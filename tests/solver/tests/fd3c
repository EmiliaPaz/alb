-- 'G' and 'H' demonstrate the same difference between coherence and consistency, but for non-normal
-- relations.  For example, the two axioms for 'G' are more obviously non-overlapping, as Int =/=
-- Float.  However, this is not sufficient to show that the functional dependency is respected.

H t u v | u ~> v.
H (Maybe t) m n if Double m n, Even n, Ord t.
H (List t) m P1 if Double m n, Eq t.
