-- Testing pairwise improvement.

F t u | t ~> u.
C t u v | t u ~> v.

C t t True; C t u False.

F True Int.
F False Bool.

-- Each of these demonstraints pairwise improvement---even without being able to prove the
-- predicates 'F a b' and 'F a c', we can use them to compute the improvement [b/c].  This, in turn,
-- allows the C predicate to be resolved.

F a b, F a c, C b c a?
C b c a if F a b, F a c?

-- Sanity check: without the pairwise improvement, the predicates cannot be resolved.  Note that the
-- C predicate can still be solved by cases; in the above examples, it was solved directly.

F a b, F a Bool, C b c a?
